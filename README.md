# Computer Vision Labs and Mini Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing the various **Computer Vision** labs and mini-projects I have worked on. In this repository, you'll find implementations of different image processing and computer vision techniques that were part of my learning journey. The following labs and mini-projects are included:

## Labs

### 1. **Image Processing Lab 1: Point Processing Techniques**
   - **Objective**: To understand the basic concepts of point processing in image processing.
   - **Description**: Implemented various point processing techniques such as darkening, brightening, inverting images, and increasing/decreasing contrast using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
   - **Techniques Used**: Image slicing, RGB channel manipulation, point processing transformations.
   - **Lab Procedure**: Loaded and displayed an image, then applied transformations like darkening, brightness adjustments, and contrast enhancements.

### 2. **Image Convolution Lab**
   - **Objective**: To understand the basics of image convolution and its applications in image processing.
   - **Description**: Worked with various convolution kernels such as mean filters, sharpening filters, and custom filters to modify image properties like blurring, sharpness, and edge detection.
   - **Techniques Used**: Image convolution with different kernels, Sobel edge detection, image blurring.
   - **Lab Procedure**: Applied convolution operations using different filters, observed the effect of kernels like `G1`, `G2`, `G3`, and `G4` on images, and used Sobel filters for edge detection.
